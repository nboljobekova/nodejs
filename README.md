## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Namba Food project.

    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── public
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── .gitlab-ci.yml
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── .env

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`/public`**: The public folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to set the page title. The script tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process. You can also add other assets to the public folder.

4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

6.  **`.gitlab-ci.yml`**: CI\CD settings.

7.  **`Dockerfile`**: Doker settings.

8.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
